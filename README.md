# COBOL to .NET Core Conversion
I'll convert the COBOL program IBMTEST3 to .NET Core, clarifying variable and procedure names while adding comments to explain the code's functionality.


# Implementation Notes
Modern Structure: I've converted the COBOL program to a modern .NET Core class structure with proper separation of concerns.

Naming Improvements:

Renamed cryptic COBOL variables to more descriptive names
Used proper C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields)
Added meaningful class and method names that reflect their purpose
Code Organization:

Used regions to organize the code logically
Separated data models into their own classes
Created interfaces for external services
Error Handling:

Added proper exception handling with try/catch blocks
Implemented logging for errors and important events
Documentation:

Added XML documentation comments to explain the purpose of classes and methods
Included comments to explain complex business logic
Modernization:

Replaced COBOL file handling with service-based I/O operations
Converted COBOL data structures to C# classes with properties
Implemented dependency injection for services
Business Logic:

Preserved the original business logic flow while making it more readable
Maintained the same processing steps as the original COBOL program
This conversion maintains the core functionality of the original COBOL program while making it much more maintainable and understandable in a modern .NET Core environment.

# Plant UML diagrams

These PlantUML diagrams provide a comprehensive visualization of the structure and operation of converted .NET Core code. They illustrate the relationships between classes, execution sequences, activities, states, components, packages, deployment, and use cases of the equipment processing system.

The diagrams are organized to present different perspectives of the system, ranging from static structure (class diagram) to dynamic aspects (sequence and activity diagrams), architecture (component and package diagrams) and deployment.
